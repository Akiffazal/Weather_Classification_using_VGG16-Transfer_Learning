# Weather_Classification_using_VGG16-Transfer_Learning
# README for Weather Classification using VGG16 Transfer Learning

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to classify weather conditions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture. The project utilizes transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained VGG16 model, which has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, to improve classification accuracy on a custom weather dataset.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akiffazal/weather-classification.git
   cd weather-classification
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Weather_Classification_using_VGG16-Transfer_Learning.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the images, and train the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images categorized into different weather conditions. Ensure that the dataset is structured properly and available in the specified directory in the notebook.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on the VGG16 architecture, which includes:

- Convolutional layers
- Max pooling layers
- Fully connected layers

Transfer learning is applied by using the pre-trained weights of the VGG16 model and fine-tuning it on the weather dataset.

## Evaluation and Classification Report

The notebook includes code to evaluate the trained model and generate a classification report. It also includes a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model.
